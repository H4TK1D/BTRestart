Tired of having to restart over and over just to find a treasure room or a planetarium? Having to wait 3-5 seconds inbetween resets?
Then fear not for this mod is for you. This is a QOL mod for the binding of isaac Repentance to make your run restarting experience a lot better with features such as:

- Instant restarts
- Rooms filter
- Curse filter (to be implemented)

All of these generated from random seeds so you can still enjoy the rng of the orignal game.
